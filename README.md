# 13.13-coin-toss
  Write a class named  Coin . The  Coin  class should have the following member variable:       •    A  string  named  sideUp . The  sideUp  member variable will hold either “heads” or “tails” indicating the side of the coin that is facing up.   The  Coin  class should have the following member functions:       •    A default constructor that randomly determines the side of the coin that is facing up (“heads” or “tails”) and initializes the  sideUp  member variable accordingly.       •    A  void  member function named  toss  that simulates the tossing of the coin. When the  toss  member function is called, it randomly determines the side of the coin that is facing up (“heads” or “tails”) and sets the  sideUp  member variable accordingly.       •    A member function named  getSideUp  that returns the value of the  sideUp  member variable.       Write a program that demonstrates the  Coin  class. The program should create an instance of the class and display the side that is initially facing up. Then, use a loop to toss the coin 20 times. Each time the coin is tossed, display the side that is facing up. The program should keep count of the number of times heads is facing up and the number of times tails is facing up, and display those values after the loop finishes
